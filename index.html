  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am Maria Gabriela Mendoza, a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KgZxzjsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">
  Prof. Shankar Sastry</a> and <a href="https://chinmaheshwari.github.io/chinmay.maheshwari/" target="_blank">

    <p>
      My research focuses on the design and control of multi-agent systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments. I draw on tools from distributed control, optimization, and game theory to develop safety-critical autonomous systems, including decentralized and distributed algorithms that incentivize coordinated behavior among homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My work has applications in Advanced Air Mobility, humanitarian robotics, and strategic routing and planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to UC Berkeley, I worked for five years as a Research Scientist at Lockheed Martin, contributing to projects ranging from hypersonic aerothermal design earlier in my career to AI and robotics research in later years, often in collaboration with academic partners. I am also deeply committed to mentoring and inclusive engineering education, and previously served as engineering faculty at Cañada College.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC) and a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My research focuses on the design of algorithms and methods for modeling, analyzing, and controlling complex interacting systems. I develop principled frameworks for coordination and decision-making in multi-agent cyber-physical systems, where physical dynamics, communication constraints, uncertainty, and strategic interactions are tightly coupled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A central theme of my work is enabling coordination and planning in realistic environments, including UAV strategic planning and multi-agent decision-making under partial observability. I emphasize modeling and simulation approaches that reflect real-world operating conditions, incorporating contextual information, uncertainty, and system-level constraints rather than idealized assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of my research is motivated by humanitarian and safety-critical applications such as disaster response and evacuation. In these settings, modeling human behavior is essential for designing autonomous systems that meaningfully assist people. I study how human decision-making, stress, and environmental context can be incorporated into algorithmic design to better align autonomous system behavior with human needs during emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodologically, I am interested in combining learning-based approaches with control-theoretic, optimization-based, and game-theoretic tools, selecting methods that are appropriate to the system and task at hand. My goal is to design autonomous systems that are effective, reliable, and principled, with safety, interpretability, and performance guarantees where possible.
