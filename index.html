    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am Maria Gabriela Mendoza, a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KgZxzjsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">
  Prof. Shankar Sastry</a> and <a href="https://chinmaheshwari.github.io/chinmay.maheshwari/" target="_blank">

    <p>
      My research focuses on the design and control of multi-agent systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments. I draw on tools from distributed control, optimization, and game theory to develop safety-critical autonomous systems, including decentralized and distributed algorithms that incentivize coordinated behavior among homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My work has applications in Advanced Air Mobility, humanitarian robotics, and strategic routing and planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to UC Berkeley, I worked for five years as a Research Scientist at Lockheed Martin, contributing to projects ranging from hypersonic aerothermal design earlier in my career to AI and robotics research in later years, often in collaboration with academic partners. I am also deeply committed to mentoring and inclusive engineering education, and previously served as engineering faculty at Cañada College.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC) and a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My research interests center on the design of algorithms and methods for modeling, analyzing, and controlling complex systems and their interactions. I am particularly interested in cyber-physical systems and multi-agent autonomous systems, where physical dynamics, communication constraints, uncertainty, and strategic decision-making interact in nontrivial ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      A core theme of my work is developing principled algorithmic frameworks for coordination and planning in realistic environments, including UAV strategic planning and multi-agent decision-making under partial observability. I focus on building models and simulations that are close to real-world operating conditions, emphasizing contextualization, uncertainty, and system-level constraints rather than idealized settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of my research is motivated by humanitarian and safety-critical applications, such as disaster response and evacuation scenarios. In these settings, understanding and modeling human behavior is essential for designing autonomous systems that meaningfully assist people rather than simply optimize abstract performance metrics. I study how human decision-making, stress, and environmental context can be incorporated into algorithmic design to better align autonomous behavior with human needs during emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a methodological perspective, I am interested in designing systems that are well-matched to their intended purpose by combining learning-based approaches with control-theoretic, optimization-based, and game-theoretic tools. I focus on selecting and integrating methods where they are most appropriate, with an emphasis on safety, interpretability, and performance guarantees when possible. My goal is to develop autonomous systems that are not only effective, but also reliable and principled in complex, real-world settings.
